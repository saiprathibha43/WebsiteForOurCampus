    <p> “Find out what you like doing best, and get someone to pay you for doing it.” is what believed, implemented in
      the daily lifestyle of Bharath Kumar Shedole a 3rd-year student currently pursuing his Bachelor in Computer
      Science Engineering from Vardhaman College of Engineering. Bharath is the kind of student who believes in building
      a career at the early stage would automate the cycle of success.
      <br>
      Let us know Bharath in detail, his achievements, interests, and about his Start-Up.<br><br>
      <b style="font-family:cursive;"> 1. Engineering is never an easy degree to complete, besides that you find
        interest to work and learn new
        things, what inspires you to do that? </b>
      <br>
      The fun fact about being an Engineer is he can become whatever he wishes to, it builds the confidence of finding
      self-potential in us and lets us work towards it. Adding to this Bharath says “My only inspiration is my Father
      who insists to work, gaining knowledge from the industrial expertise, never complains about academics, he says do
      not get the thought of working for less pay, think in the view of learning and applying it in the real world to
      resolve community-related problems.”
      <br><br>
      <b style="font-family:cursive;"> 2. How did the idea of Yoga and Earn(Start Up) start, how does it work? </b><br>

      As I go daily to Work-out, I thought that my friends are busy texting and gossiping about things that are not
      important, I suggested to them why can't they just focus on being healthy and fit. that's how my idea started.
      It's simple as they have to log in to the app daily and they get different exercises to perform upload as a reel
      or tag us and upload it on our app. And if they maintain the daily streak as they maintain the snap streak they
      get some perks.

      <b style="font-family:cursive;">3. You are studying and earning at the same time, what is the mode of income? </b>
      <br>
      The mode of income is by doing internships mostly up to now I have earned around 25-30k from Stumagz. I think I
      didn't share with anyone till now even in lockdown Stumagz has helped me to earn around 10k. “It is not about the
      money, but then the network and the opportunities which Stumagz provided me in the early stage helped me a lot” -
      adds Bharath.
